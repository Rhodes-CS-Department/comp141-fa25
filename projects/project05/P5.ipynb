    "# Project 5: Tanchi Boska (\"Corn Game\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Memphis, TN, is located on the so-called \"Fourth Bluff\" of the traditional Chickasaw homelands. The Chickasaw traditionally occupied parts of north Misssissippi, Alabama, and west Tennessee. The Choctaw are a very closely related group of people who traditionally occupied parts of Mississippi and Alabama. These groups had rich political, economic, agricultural, and spiritual practices, including matrilineal inheritance, communal crop management, lunar calendars, and games which could prevent or substitute war.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tanchi Boska\n",
    "\n",
    "Gambling games, with corn or peach pits or bone dice were very common among the Choctaw and Chickasaw. One simple game that the Choctaw played was called Tanchi Boska, the \"corn game\", which was a simple gambling game, similar to throwing dice. Here is an excerpt from the blog of a hobbyist researcher:\n",
    "\n",
    "*According to both Bushnell and Stewart Culin, the Choctaws had a game which resembled dice, and was called by the Choctaws “tanche boska” (or corn game). Bushnell’s description says in part: “This (game) was played with either five or seven kernels of corn blackened on one side. Holding all the kernels in one hand, the player tossed them onto the ground, each player having three throws. The one making the greatest number of points in the aggregate won. Each ‘black’ turned up counted one point; all ‘white’ up counted either five or seven points, according to the number of kernels used. Any number of persons could play, but usually there were only two.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Culin, in his description of the game, insists that it was played with eight grains of corn; so we can assume that the number of grains used were variable.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's enumerate the rules of this game:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is a 2-player game\n",
    "2. The players agree on how many corn kernels they will throw. \n",
    "3. The players agree on how many rounds to play.\n",
    "4. Black kernels are 1 point each. The players agree what white kernels are worth. \n",
    "5. On a player's turn, they throw their corn kernels. Some will be \"black\" and some will be \"white\".\n",
    "6. Players count their score in each round and add them up for their total score at the end of the game.\n",
    "7. The player with the most points wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an interactive program that allows a player to play this game against the computer. Here's example output for the program:\n",
