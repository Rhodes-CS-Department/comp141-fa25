    "## Writing to a File\n",
    "* For a program to retain data between the times it is run, you must save the data\n",
    "* Data is saved to a file, typically on computer disk\n",
    "* Saved data can be retrieved and used at a later time\n",
    "* __\"Writing data to\"__: saving data on a file\n",
    "* __Output file__: a file that data is written to\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading From a File\n",
    "* An easy way to get data into your program is to read it in from a file.\n",
    "* For program's that require lots of data, this is much more efficient than having someone manually enter the data\n",
    "* __Reading data from__: process of retrieving data from a file\n",
    "* __Input file__: a file from which data is read\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Files and File Access Methods\n",
    "There are two main types of files\n",
    "* Text file: contains data that has been encoded as text (human readable)\n",
    "* Binary file: contains data that has not been converted to text\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to access data stored in a file\n",
    "* Sequential access: file read sequentially from beginning to end, canâ€™t skip ahead\n",
    "* Direct access: can jump directly to any piece of data in the file\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will only use text files, and access them sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Filename extensions__: short sequences of characters that appear at the end of a filename preceded by a period\n",
    "* Extension indicates type of data stored in the file\n",
    "* Examples: .py, .docx, .xlsx, .pdf, .txt\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Objects: object associated with a specific file\n",
    "* Provides a way for a program to work with the file: file object referenced by a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a file object, you use the built-in `open` function, which is used to open a file\n",
    "* Creates a file object and associates it with a file on the disk\n",
    "* General format: `file_object = open(filename, mode)`\n",
    "* __Mode__: string specifying how the file will be opened\n",
    "* Example: reading only (r'), writing ('w'), and appending ('a')\n",
    "\n",
    "__Write vs. Append Mode__\n",
    "* __Write__ Mode ('w'): if the file already exists it is overwritten (previous contents are lost forever)\n",
    "* __Append__ Mode ('a'): if file exists, new data is written to the file at the end of the current contents. If the file does not exist, it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Specifying the Location of a File__\n",
    "\n",
    "* If `open` function receives a filename that does not contain a path, assumes that file is in same directory as program\n",
    "* Ex: `open('notes.txt')` will assume that a file named `notes.txt` is in the `schwamb` folder\n",
    "* If program is running and file is created, it is created in the same directory as the program\n",
    "* Can specify alternative path and file name in the `open` function argument\n",
    "* Ex. `open('comp141-fa25/king/notes.txt')` will open a file named `notes.txt` in Prof. King's notes folder\n",
    "* You can assume that all files are in the same directory as your python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__File Object Methods__ (functions that belong to an object)\n",
    "* `write`: used to write data to a file (assumes file is opened in write/append mode)\n",
    "* Format: `file_object.write(string)`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `close`: need to close the file when you are done writing to it/reading from it\n",
    "* Format: `file_object.close()`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `read`: reads entire file contents into memory and returns it as a string (assumes file is opened in read mode)\n",
    "* Format: `contents = file_object.read()`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `readline`: reads a single line from the file and returns it as a string (assumes file is opened in read mode)\n",
    "* Format: `line = file_object.readline()`\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Read position__: marks the location of the next item to be read from a file. Every time you call the readline method, the next line of the file will be read. (Never reads the same line twice).\n",
