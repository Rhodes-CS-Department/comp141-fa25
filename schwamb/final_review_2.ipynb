    "## Final Information\n",
    "The final, like the midterm, is an oral exam. Just like the midterm, I'll send out a calendly link and you'll sign up for a slot. This time I'm making the slots 30min rather than 20min so I'll hopefully be running behind less. I'll still aim for a 20min exam, the 30min will just give me more leeway. I'll focus on topics we've covered since the midterm since I have limited time, but theoretically I could ask anything we've covered in the class.\n",

    "## Final grade information\n",
    "On Canvas, there's a link to the final grade worksheet. This allows you to pick the weighting of your final grade (in conversation with me). Please come to your final time with it already filled out - you'll have to guess a bit at your grade on the final exam, but that will allow you to have both your final exam grade and your final grade in the class by the time you leave my office after the final exam. (It will likely not show up in Canvas/Workday till all the final exams have been given, but you'll know what it is.)\n",
