    "# Let's make a game!\n",
    "Welcome to game jam! If you've never coded a game before, this notebook is intended to help you learn how to do some things you might want to do in your game. Feel free to copy it and customize it to do whatever sort of game you want. It's also a good look at how to make programs that are modular and well-designed.\n",

    "## The Game: Up & Down the River\n",
    "Up & Down the River is a trick-taking card game for any number of players. Each hand, the first player to play plays a card. Every other player then must play a card in that same suit. The person who played the highest card in the hand wins the \"trick\" and is the first person to play on the next hand. If a person has no cards in the suit that was played by the first person to play that hand, they can play a card of a different suit. One suit is designated the trump suit at the beginning of the round. Cards played in the trump suit will beat out any cards of other suits, even if the card is lower. For example, the first person to play a hand plays an ace of diamonds, everyone must play diamonds unless they have no diamonds. Another player is out of diamonds and plays the two of spades. If spades is the trump suit for that round, the two of spades beats the ace of diamonds even though the ace is the highest card. If another player had played a six of spades, however, the six of spades would beat out the two of spades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each round, players bid on how many hands (\"tricks\") they think they can win. After all the hands have been played, all players get one point for each trick they won. If they won exactly the number of tricks they bid, they get an additional 10 points. The last person to bid in a round cannot bid in such a way that the total number of tricks players have bid equals the number of hands in the round.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first round, as many cards as possible are dealt to the players (i.e., the number of cards not in play is equal to 52 % n_players). After that, the number of cards in play decreases by one each round. So if you start with 13 cards on the first round (4 players), on the second round you will play with 12 cards, then 11 cards in the third round, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the last round, each player has just one card. The catch with the last round is that in this round, you cannot look at your own card, only the cards of every other player. Every player bids, and then all cards are played at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make a computer version of this game that can be played by passing the computer back and forth between different players!"

This function doesn't allow a player to play a card that is not in their hand, or play a card that is a different suit from the card that was first played that hand (the card that was \"led\").

A trump card cannot be led (played first in a hand) until a trump has already been played out of suit before (this is known as the trump suit being broken).

I'd like to adjust the play order as it would be adjusted in a real trick-taking game, with the person who won the last trick going leading and continuing around the table from there. Let's see if I can adjust the player order by rotating through the list of player names. I'll use a function named `rotate_player_order` for this. I'm also going to use a new variable for this named `player_order` which I will initialize as `player_names`. The reason for this is because I'd like to preserve the initial order of players so that the first player to bid and lead rotates between rounds."

    "The last thing we need to do is to account for the way the last round works since it's different than the previous rounds. In the last round, all players are dealt a single card which they do not look at. Instead, they place it on their forehead so that each player can see all cards *except* their own, and make their bid based on that information. As usual the last player cannot make the bid equal to the total number of tricks, so they will be unable to bid one if no one has bid one already, or bid zero if someone has already bid one. Then all cards are played simultaneously and the winner takes the trick. The score is calculated as usual. The only thing that really changes this round is bidding, so we'll just add a function called `get_last_bid()` which will handle the unique bidding procedure for the last round."
