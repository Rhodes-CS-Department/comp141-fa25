    "In the game of tic tac toe, players alternate placing Xs and Os on a board until one player gets three of their symbol in a row, column, or diagonal. We will store the tic tac toe board as a 2D list of integers, where a zero means a space on the board is empty, a 1 means it is filled with an X, and a -1 means it is filled with an O. This will make it easier later to detect wins.\n",
