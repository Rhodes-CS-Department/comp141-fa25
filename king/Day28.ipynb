    "## Practice\n",
    "1. Web servers and Web browsers need to know a file's type so they know how to display the file. The file's type is based on the extension of the file's name. For example, we name our Python scripts with the .py extension and our HTML files with the .html extension. Using help(str), look at how to use the rfind method and compare with how the find method is used. Use the `rfind` method to determine a file's type. \n",
    "Example output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "What is the name of your file? index.html\n",
    "That is a html file.\n",
    "What is the name of your file? picture.jpg\n",
    "That is a jpg file.\n",
    "What is the name of your file? 16.functions.pdf\n",
    "That is a pdf file.\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Write a function called `count_dups` that\tcounts the number of back-to-back duplicated characters\tin a string. Example: `count_dups(\"balloon\")` returns 2\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a function called `is_palindrome` that takes in a string as a parameter and returns True if it is a palindrome, and False otherwise. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.  In your algorithm, remove spaces from the string. You should consider upper and lower case letters as the same, .i.e., \"A man A plan A canal Panama\" is a palindrome. (What string methods can you use to accomplish this before processing?) However, you don't need to consider punctuation as special cases.\n",
    "Some example palindromes: \"kayak\", \"A man A plan A canal Panama\".  Example: `is_palindrome('kayak')` returns True"
