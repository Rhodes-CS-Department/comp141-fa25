    "* __\"Writing data to\"__: saving data on a file\n",
    "* __Output file__: a file that data is written to\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading From a File\n",
    "* An easy way to get data into your program is to read it in from a file.\n",
    "* For program's that require lots of data, this is much more efficient than having someone manually enter the data\n",
    "* __Reading data from__: process of retrieving data from a file\n",
    "* __Input file__: a file from which data is read\n",

    "## Types of Files and File Access Methods\n",
